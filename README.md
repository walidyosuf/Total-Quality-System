Features
Mechanical Test (الاختبار الميكانيكي):

Evaluate steel mechanical properties (Yield, Tensile, Elongation) against various international standards (EN, ASTM, JIS, DIN) and steel grades.

Generate detailed comparison reports indicating compliance.

Print reports and export data to CSV/Excel format.

Includes fields for project name, lab name, test date, prepared by, approved by, and description for comprehensive record-keeping.

Chemical Analysis (التحليل الكيميائي):

Analyze the chemical composition of steel (Carbon, Manganese, Silicon, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Chromium, Nickel, Molybdenum) against selected standards and grades.

Provides a detailed breakdown of compliance for each element.

Offers report generation, printing, and CSV/Excel export capabilities.

Supports project-specific data entry.

Bolt Specifications Checker (مدقق مواصفات المسامير):

Verify the dimensions and properties of various fasteners (Bolts, Nuts, Washers) against DIN standards (e.g., DIN 7990, DIN 933 for bolts; DIN 555, DIN 934 for nuts; DIN 125, DIN 126, DIN 127 for washers).

Dynamically adjusts input fields based on the selected fastener type and standard.

Provides a quick check and report on conformance.

Dimensional Quality Review (مراجعة أبعاد القطاع):

Assess the dimensional accuracy of different structural sections (Angles, Plates, Pipes, Rods, Beams) according to relevant EN standards (e.g., EN 10025, EN 10029, EN 10210, EN 10060, EN 10034).

Input nominal and actual dimensions to check against specified tolerances.

Generates a report detailing compliance for each dimension.

Frequently Asked Questions (الأسئلة الشائعة):

Towers (في الأبراج): Common questions and answers related to tower/mast sections based on BS EN 1090-2:2018.

Columns (في الأعمدة): FAQs regarding steel column manufacturing and tolerances, also referencing BS EN 1090-2:2018.

Galvanization (في الجلفنة): Key information and standards (ISO 1461:2009) for hot-dip galvanizing, including coating thickness, adhesion, and appearance.
